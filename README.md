MEDCONNECT: Online Doctor Appointment and Video Consultation is an innovative Android-based application aimed at transforming the traditional healthcare appointment system into a digital, user-friendly platform. The app addresses key challenges faced by patients and doctors, especially in remote areas, by offering features like doctor browsing, appointment booking, and secure video consultations. Patients can easily register, view doctor profiles, and consult virtually, while doctors can manage appointments and communicate with patients through an intuitive interface. The backend is powered by Firebase for real-time data management and authentication, with Jitsi integrated for seamless video conferencing. An admin panel ensures effective oversight of user and appointment management. The project followed an agile development approach, involving iterative design, coding, testing, and user feedback to build a responsive and reliable system. Data was collected through surveys and interviews, highlighting a strong demand for accessible and secure digital healthcare solutions. Key challenges, such as limited direct feedback from doctors and integrating advanced security within time constraints, were resolved through strategic planning and continuous testing. MEDCONNECT significantly improves healthcare accessibility and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for clinics, hospitals, and telemedicine platforms.
